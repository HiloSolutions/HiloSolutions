I'm a software developer who is passionate about making software solutions more accessible and user-friendly, and building technology to elevate business operations. Some technologies I enjoy working with are PSQL, JavaScript and it's various libraries, Express, and Ruby on Rails. My interest in the react ecosystem has lead me to launch many projects including Nutritionship.
