I'm a software developer specializing in JavaScript technologies and CRM development. While I enjoy experimenting with many different libraries and frameworks, I have the most extensive experience with the technologies listed in the toolbox below.

In addition to software development, I have worked in a agile development settings as both a researcher and project manager. I am passionate about developing technologies which facilitate better cross-departmental comunication and user-experience. Technology is developing exponentially and it is important that we build tools to help veryone - not just developers.
